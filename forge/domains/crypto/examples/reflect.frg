  Note on bounds:
    - bounds are *not* necessary to give for the skeleton sigs (in this case, 
      skeleton_reflect_0, exactly 1 skeleton_reflect_1, exactly 1 skeleton_reflect_2)
      because they are declared as "one" sigs by the expander, and thus act as constants.

    - Attacker and AttackerStrand are likewise "one" sigs (declared in base.frg).

  Note on output:

    - You may see multiple shapes produced by the visualizer, depending on which the 
      solver generates first. This query says that there must be an initiator and 
      a responder strand, but those terms (initiator, responder) don't have semantic
      weight. So all we have is their isolated perspectives, and (e.g.) these two shapes 
      both work:

      initiator          attacker         responder
          ----------------->
                             ----------------->
                             <-----------------
          <-----------------

      attacker           responder        initiator
          ------------------>
          <------------------------------------
          <------------------
          ------------------------------------>

      After all, from the responder's POV it receives a valid message 1 and replies
      with a valid message 2; similarly for the initiator. The one important thing to 
      notice is that the contents of the message must be something the attacker has 
      to start with, such as one of the public keys.
