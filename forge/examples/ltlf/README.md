# Finite-Trace LTL

This is a basic model of finite-trace LTL. I (Tim Nelson) decided to build it while we were writing our [paper on LTLf misconceptions](https://cs.brown.edu/~tbn/publications/ltlf-misconceptions.pdf). I didn't finish it at the time, but wrapped it up in early 2025. 

I'm including it in Forge's standard example suite as a counterpoint to the boolean logic model: both represent the syntax and semantics of a logic, but LTLf adds the complication of traces and time indexes, and so involves a few different modeling choices.
