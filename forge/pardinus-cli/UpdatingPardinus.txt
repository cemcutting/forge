From command line:
1. cd <pardinus-repo-parent-dir>/Pardinus
2. git checkout <branch desired; likely master>
3. mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true install
	If it runs tests, it fails a couple so the build fails
	and the jar doesn't appear.
	However, it compiles properly so we still get a nice jar
	if we skip running the tests.
	This will create pardinus-1.2.3.jar in the Pardinus/target directory.
4. cd <forge-repo-parent-dir>/Forge/forge/pardinus-cli/jar
5. cp <pardinus-repo-parent-dir>/Pardinus/target/pardinus-1.2.3.jar kodkod.jar
	For now, I'm still calling it kodkod.jar -
	I'll deal with renaming after we know it works.
	Also, you don't need kodkod-cli.jar anymore if it's in there.
6. cd ../..
7. raco pkg remove forge
8. raco pkg install

If running via waf (which is what the README in Pardinus suggests), be aware that 
you'll need wget and opam.
